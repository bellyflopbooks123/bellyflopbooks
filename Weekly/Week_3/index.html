<div class="spread"><img src="Cover.png" alt="Cover Image"></div><div class="spread"><p>They’re sweet and they’re gentle and hum little tunes,<br>
    They dust with a smile and bake under moons.<br>
    They piddle with puzzles and shuffle in socks,<br>
    Then vanish each night like they’re out picking locks.<br>
    They yawn after dinner and say they feel old,<br>
    But I’ve seen one deadlift a couch colored gold.<br>
    What happens at night when they sneak out so quick?<br>
    Is Grandma just Grandma… or up to some trick?</p><img src="page 1.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>She kissed us goodnight with a grin in her eye,<br>
    Then whispered, “Be good,” with a sneaky goodbye.<br>
    She tucked in our blankets and turned off the light,<br>
    Then darted outside in the dead of the night.<br>
    We followed in stealth like two tiny spies,<br>
    With our stuffies in tow and sleep in our eyes.<br>
    She wasn’t alone—we gasped at the sight!<br>
    It was Grandma Kelly… her pants way too tight.</p><img src="page 2.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>We slipped through the door as they vanished from view,<br>
    Past sprinklers and sneakers and one garden shoe.<br>
    They crept down the street like two sneaky raccoons,<br>
    While we tiptoed behind by the light of the moon.<br>
    They darted through hedges and into the park,<br>
    We followed in silence, concealed by the dark.<br>
    They reached a steel door with a code on the side—<br>
    Then vanished within as it opened up wide.</p><img src="page 4.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>We slipped through a door with a slam and a clank,<br>
    Past posters of wrestlers and lockers that stank.<br>
    The ring lights came on with a flicker and hum,<br>
    And chants filled the air like a pounding war drum.<br>
    Grandma leaped into the ring with a yell,<br>
    She ripped off her robe like a bat outta...well.<br>
    A legend appeared in the gym's glowing beams—<br>
    With biceps that sparkled and thighs that'd crush spleens.</p><img src="Page 5.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>Then Kelly stepped forward and let out a roar,<br>
    She flipped through the ropes and dropped to the floor.<br>
    Her shades hit the mat with a thundering clink—<br>
    She stared down the ring with a confident wink.<br>
    With “NANNA” on tights and a scowl on her face,<br>
    She pointed and growled, then strutted in place.<br>
    The crowd held its breath as the tension turned red—<br>
    And Grandma just nodded—no words need be said.</p><img src="Page 6.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>The lights slowly dimmed and the speakers went BOOM,<br>
    The crowd turned to stone, two giants filled the room.<br>
    The Bicep Brothers stomped into the ring,<br>
    Each flexing so hard you could hear tendons sing.<br>
    Their arms were like hams and their chests like a wall,<br>
    Their necks disappeared—they had none at all.<br>
    They cracked all their knuckles and growled through their teeths,<br>
    The Grandmas just yawned… and rolled up their sleeves.</p><img src="Page 7.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>Then thunder returned and the smoke swirled in tight,<br>
    The two stepped forward, each blocking the light.<br>
    The Bicep Brothers, both flexing with pride,<br>
    With traps like volcanoes and lats three feet wide.<br>
    The ring nearly shook from their synchronized growl—<br>
    But Grandma just grinned and adjusted her cowl.<br>
    “I’ll take the big one,” said Pam with a crack—<br>
    And Kelly just nodded, “I’ve got your back.”</p><img src="page 8.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>The Brothers roared loud like two busted-up trains,<br>
    The bell gave a DING! and it rattled our brains.<br>
    Pam raised a chair with arthritis and sass,<br>
    Then cracked it on Biceps and flattened his—mass.<br>
    Kelly came flying from three ladders high,<br>
    Yelled “Elbows of Love!” as she dropped from the sky.<br>
    She pinned him down flat, gave his shoulder a tap,<br>
    Then whispered, “You’re a nice young man, but it’s time for a nap.”</p><img src="page 9.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>The match was now over, the belts had been won,<br>
    The Biceps lay groaning, their flexing all done.<br>
    We tiptoed away, thinking no one would see—<br>
    But Pam met us both by the exit marquee.<br>
    She raised one brow with that look moms all know,<br>
    Then whispered, “Next time, try ducking more low.”<br>
    The crowd shook the roof in a rumbling roar:<br>
    “Bonecrusher Pam!” and “Slam-Maw! Encore!”</p><img src="page 10.png" alt="Illustration"></div><div class="spread"><p>Now back at home, with the chaos all done,<br>
    She fluffed up our pillows and kissed everyone.<br>
    The house was all quiet, the moon shining thick,<br>
    But we knew the truth—she had bones she could pick.<br>
    She smiled and she hummed as she turned off the light,<br>
    Then flexed in the mirror before saying “Goodnight.”<br>
    So if you meet Grandma and think she’s a treat...<br>
    Be nice—or get slammed with a folding chair seat.</p><img src="Page 3.png" alt="Illustration"></div></body></html>

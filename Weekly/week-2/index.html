    Prince Hector the Mighty! A legend! A flame!<br/>
    The dragon-slayer kingmakers shouted his name.<br/>
    He'd tamed molten caves and brought beasts to their knees,<br/>
    With a sword that could slice through the thickest of trees.<br/>
    No monster had bested his shining gold blade—<br/>
    His cape caught the wind like a crimson cascade.
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 1" src="page_1.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    This time, the quest was the fiercest of all:<br/>
    A dragon of dragons—immense, ancient, tall.<br/>
    She perched on a mountain no man dared ascend,<br/>
    They whispered her name like the world’s final end.<br/>
    He polished his armor, enchanted and bright,<br/>
    Then charged through the woods like a comet of might.
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 2" src="page_2.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    His stallion breathed fire (they were both pretty mad),<br/>
    The forest birds panicked, the squirrels all went bad.<br/>
    The trees bowed in fear as he thundered on through,<br/>
    With a sword blessed by wizards and dipped in sky-blue.<br/>
    His war cry was wild, his mission was clear—<br/>
    The mountain itself seemed to shiver in fear.
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 3" src="page_3.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    He reached the great lair with a thundering stomp...<br/>
    And stopped when he saw… a small garden and lamp?<br/>
    A hammock swung slow in the soft mountain breeze,<br/>
    And incense was wafting through lavender trees.<br/>
    There sat the great dragon—her scales tinged with gray.<br/>
    She sipped from a coconut. “Hi, child. Nice day?”
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 4" src="page_4.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    He drew out his blade, glowing hot in the sun.<br/>
    She nodded. “Oh neat. Is that magical, hon?”<br/>
    He lunged with a roar—but she floated away,<br/>
    To water her marigolds, smiling, “Okay.”<br/>
    “I don’t do the fight thing,” she said with a shrug.<br/>
    “Have some papaya. Or maybe a hug?”
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 5" src="page_5.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    He swung, he jabbed, he spun with a roar,<br/>
    But she dodged him by slowly shuffling the floor.<br/>
    He crashed through her garden and scorched all her tea,<br/>
    She just lit some sage and said, “Let it be.”<br/>
    She offered a beanbag and set out some flan.<br/>
    “Don’t burn yourself out, little cinnamon man.”
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 6" src="page_6.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    He yelled, “Face me proper! Quit dancing around!”<br/>
    She said, “I’m just lookin’ for mushrooms I found.”<br/>
    He screamed at the sky, his whole body steamed—<br/>
    “This is not how a dragon should act or be dreamed!”<br/>
    She hummed as she sprinkled herbs into a stew—<br/>
    With three little birds softly singing in view.
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 7" src="page_7.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    His blade wouldn’t cut her. His rage wouldn’t land.<br/>
    She offered him lotion and held out her hand.<br/>
    “No hate in this home. Just hammocks and peace.<br/>
    No roars, no revenge, and no dragon-police.”<br/>
    He dropped to his knees with a dramatic cry—<br/>
    “Why won’t you just fight me?” She blinked. “Oh my.”
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 8" src="page_8.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    She brought him a blanket and tucked in his feet,<br/>
    Then gave him a snack and a dragonfruit treat.<br/>
    He twitched with confusion, unsure what to do…<br/>
    His muscles still flexed, but his soul kind of knew.<br/>
    This dragon was different. No battles. No fame.<br/>
    Just warmth, herbal tea, and a long dragon name.
  </div></div>
<div class="spread image"><img alt="Page 9" src="page_9.png"/></div>
<div class="spread"><div class="verse">
    She packed him a bundle with homemade granola,<br/>
    Some peppermint balm and a gift from her soula,<br/>
    A thermos of soup, a soft dragon plush,<br/>
    A hug with her tail and a pat with a whoosh.<br/>
    She tied it all up with a shimmering thread—<br/>
    Then gently bonked horns with the top of his head.<br/>
    He blinked at the bundle, and his horse gave a bleat...<br/>
    Thus, Hector the Dragonslayer met his defeat.
